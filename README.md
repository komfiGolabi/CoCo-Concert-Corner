### Code

* Whole project was based on the mini walk through project from Code Institute. Whole Python section and its functionality is taken from that project and once the skeleton and all the database conncetions were made, I started to change all the layout, adjusting it to the needs of my project. 

 * Navbar Menu was taken from Materialize CSS framework, using a dropdown menu, footer as well

## Testing

[Check responsiveness](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkomfigolabi.github.io%2FExplore-Ethiopia%2F)

[HTML Validator Page](https://validator.w3.org/)

Html validation was throwing errors when used the code from the working environment, so the validation was made by opening the website and using the view source option, when right clicking on the mouse and then validated.

[CSS Validator Page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* Code from style.css was copied as a direct input into the CSS validator page and no errors were found.



Google Dev Tool: Lighthouse 

![Desktop Lighthouse Testing]()
![Mobile Lighthouse Testing]()

Lighthouse testing was fluctuating slightly due to the course of the project and the photos are showing the final results.


* Website was tested on various browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozzila Firefox and on all of those performed well.
