### Code

 * Navbar Menu was taken from Materialize CSS framework, using a dropdown menu, footer as well
 * [quiz](https://code-boxx.com/simple-javascript-quiz/), the code seemed overly complicated in the website, so with help of my mentor Antonio Rodriguez, I rewrote the code, so the effect would be the same, but with my understanding of Javascript and with simplified code.
 * Booking form was taken from the Bootstrap component section and modified for the project.
